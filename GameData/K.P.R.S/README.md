you need to put out a TransmitterBase, it's  a copy of another part for now
 and should be paired with a probe core
 Once out, you can right-click on the transmitter base to select a radio, then activate it
To receive, you need an antenna
then click the radio button and have fun

The Logs
These are text files that the game spits out for debugging purposes as it runs; if something broke horribly in-game, there will be something in here about it. You should upload the entire log as a file (i.e. not to pastebin); you can use dropbox or an equivalent host to upload the file. Make sure the entire file gets uploaded; you may have to zip it first, as logs can be very long.  DON'T paste the entire log into a thread post! That unnecessarily bloats the thread. Here is where you can find the log:
 
Windows:	%USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\Squad\Kerbal Space Program\Player.log
 
Mac OS X:	Open Console, on the left side of the window there is a menu that says 'Reports'. Scroll down the list and find the one which says 
			"Log Reports", click that.  A list of files will be displayed in the top part of the window, in there will be 
			Player.Log ( Files>~/Library/	Logs>Unity>Player.log ).  Right-click on it and select "Reveal in Finder".
 
Linux:		~/.config/unity3d/Squad/Kerbal\ Space\ Program/Player.log
