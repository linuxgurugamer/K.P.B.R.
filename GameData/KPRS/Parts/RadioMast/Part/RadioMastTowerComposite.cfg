	description = Fully contracted out to Alphadyne Construction Group, the AMTUX-AT "Dudley" Complete Broadcast Antenna Tower is the complete/real deal. Wanna start your own radio station? You're in luck! (Just don't take it to your destination in one piece. It's highly recommended that you use SimpleConstruction or Extraplanetary Launchpads to build this at your destination.) WARNING: The Kerbin Communications Commission hasn't completed its EMR exposure review of this tower so be sure to keep your Kerbals away while it's transmitting.  Notes from the field: Can be used with the stock inventory system.
