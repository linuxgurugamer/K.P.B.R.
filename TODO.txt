BUGS




TODO

	Test reverts to editor and reverts to flight
	Ease-in/Ease-out refers to the volume of the station


	
Radio UI and you need to use the Parts Manager Box to flip stations and activate things, its not really straight forward (took me a while to understand how this all worked). Is there a receiver that is required to pick up stations?

	I assume you are referring to the PAW?  



Radio Kicks out the minute the Kerbal leaves the ship (EVA it goes dark see screenshot) and other ships there is a dead period, 

	I haven't even addressed EVA yet, not sure what to do.

and when you go back to the ship it starts play at the beginning of the song, 
I can see this as "Really" annoying. Rather have it where you are in physical range of a ship and 
ideally there is a "ease-in/ease-out" if you can't do a hand-off to avoid the jarring. 
"Ease-Out / Static / Ease-In" might be better, similar idea when turning radio on/off.


What is the "Range" of the transmitters? I tossed a bunch of antennas as I though it was linked to that and then noted it was not.

	Stock Antennas don't affect the range at this time, other than making it possible to receive a station.  Antennas on the tower do nothing for the mod, but you can use them for other stuff
	The basic range is supposed to be from Kerbin to the Mun without any static
	
Last Note: Some of the Songs got flagged by YouTube on some of the other stations.

	Understood, already updated the forum page and README

It’s a copyright claim, not a strike (just means they get any money off your video). So a heads up for YouTubers/streamers should be included in the readme
