Transmitter part

MM cfg to patch antennas to add RadioPartModule to each antenna

Define a config file which would specify the audio file, the station name, and where it is
Read that file

Create a button for the radio station

Antenna module, to specify if it can receive the radio stations

calculate distance from where you are to the station
Create a window to allow selection of station.  I can think of a few ways to do that, a simple list box, a scrolling box which shows just a few, etc
Calculate the audio volume of the station
Calculate the audio volume of the static
Play the file
